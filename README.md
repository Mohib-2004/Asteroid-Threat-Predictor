The Asteroid Threat Predictor is a data-driven tool designed to analyze and predict the potential threat level of asteroids approaching Earth. Built using a Near Earth Object (NEO) dataset, this project uses machine learning techniques to classify and identify potentially hazardous asteroids based on their orbital and physical characteristics.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and formats raw NEO data from NASAâ€™s dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key attributes like size, velocity, distance, and hazardous status.

Machine Learning Model: Trains classification models to predict if an asteroid is potentially hazardous.

Prediction Interface: Allows users to input asteroid data and get real-time hazard predictions.

Evaluation Metrics: Measures model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Artificial Neural Network & Fine tuning

Technologies & Tools
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (ML Models)

Jupyter Notebook (for development and EDA)


Outputs
Classification of whether an asteroid is Potentially Hazardous (PHA) or Not Hazardous

Visual plots showing data distribution and correlations

Model performance metrics for assessment
